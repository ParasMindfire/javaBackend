Content-Type, Authorization`

## 8. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

CSRF tricks a logged-in user's browser into making an unwanted request to your app.

**Example:**
- You log in to bank.com (session cookie stored in browser)
- You visit a malicious site evil.com
- That site makes a hidden POST request to bank.com/transfer?amount=1000&to=hacker
- Browser sends your bank.com session cookie automatically, so server thinks it's a legitimate request from you
- Money transferred ‚Üí attacker wins

### Solution: CSRF Tokens

The server issues a CSRF token (a random secret value). Every state-changing request (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) must include this token. Since attacker's site cannot read the token, they can't forge requests. 

In Spring Security: CSRF protection is enabled by default for non-GET methods (POST, PUT, DELETE). Spring Security adds a hidden input field with CSRF token in forms.

## 9. How Can You Protect from CSRF?

### a) Synchronizer Token Pattern

- Server generates a unique, random token for each session (or even each request)
- Token is embedded in forms or AJAX responses
- Client must send back this token in every state-changing request (POST/PUT/DELETE)
- Since an attacker's site cannot read the token (due to Same-Origin Policy), they cannot forge valid requests

#### Example Flow

**User logs in** ‚Üí server stores session + generates CSRF token.

HTML form includes a hidden field:

```html
<form action="/transfer" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="A1B2C3D4E5F6" />
    <input type="text" name="amount">
    <button type="submit">Transfer</button>
</form>
```

So now your browser has:
- a) Session cookie (JSESSIONID=12345)
- b) CSRF token (XYZ123SECRET)

**You submit the form** ‚Üí token sent. Your browser sends:

```
POST /transfer
Cookie: JSESSIONID=12345
_csrf=XYZ123SECRET
```

Server checks:
- Does the cookie match a logged-in user?
- Does the CSRF token match the one it issued?
- If yes ‚Üí allow the request

**Now when Attacker tries from evil.com**

Suppose attacker hosts this on evil.com:

```html
<form action="https://bank.com/transfer" method="POST">
   <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000">
</form>
<script>document.forms[0].submit();</script>
```

Browser sends:
```
POST /transfer
Cookie: JSESSIONID=12345   (because you're logged in to bank.com)
_csrf=???                  (NO TOKEN!)
```

The attacker cannot guess or read your XYZ123SECRET token, because of the Same-Origin Policy.

**Same-Origin Policy (why attacker can't read token)**

Same-Origin Policy is a browser rule:
- A webpage (like evil.com) cannot read data from another domain (bank.com)
- JavaScript running on evil.com cannot peek into:
  - Responses from bank.com
  - Cookies for bank.com
  - Hidden form fields or tokens from bank.com

So even if evil.com tricks your browser into sending a request, it can't know the CSRF token. Without the correct token, the request fails.

### b) SameSite Cookie Attribute

Cookies can be marked with SameSite flag ‚Üí tells browsers when to send cookies with requests.

**SameSite=Strict**
‚Üí Cookies sent only for requests from same site.
‚Üí If a malicious site tries to POST to your app, browser will not send the session cookie.

**SameSite=Lax (default in modern browsers)**
‚Üí Cookies sent for normal navigation (like clicking a link), but not for hidden forms/images.

**SameSite=None; Secure**
‚Üí Cookies allowed in cross-site requests, but must use HTTPS.

When server sets cookie:
```
Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=12345; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict
```

If user is logged in and visits evil.com, and that site tries to send:

```html
<form action="https://bank.com/transfer" method="POST">
   <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000">
</form>
```

Browser will not send JSESSIONID cookie to bank.com because request originated from another site. Attack prevented at the browser level.

**In Spring Boot**

You can enforce this in application.properties:

```properties
server.servlet.session.cookie.same-site=strict
```

## 10. Storing User Credentials

### a) In-Memory Authentication

**What it is:** You hardcode usernames, passwords, and roles directly in the Spring config.

**Use Case:**
- Small apps
- Prototyping
- Unit/integration testing

**Pros:** Easy to set up, no external dependency.

**Cons:** Not secure, not scalable (every time you add a user, you must change code & restart app).

### b) Database (JDBC/JPA) Authentication

**What it is:** User credentials are stored in your DB (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

**Use Case:**
- Real production apps with many users
- Flexible because you can define custom schemas

**Pros:** Centralized, persistent, can be managed easily.

**Cons:** You must ensure passwords are hashed & secured.

### c) LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)

**What it is:** A protocol to access directory services (like Microsoft Active Directory, OpenLDAP).

**Use Case:**
- Large organizations with centralized identity management
- Enterprises with thousands of employees

**Pros:** Centralized management, integrates with enterprise systems.

**Cons:** Setup & maintenance overhead.

## 11. Encoding vs Hashing vs Encryption

### a) Encoding: Transform Data - One Form to Another

- Does NOT use a key or password
- Is reversible
- Typically NOT used for securing data
- **Use cases:** Compression, Streaming
- **Example:** Base 64, Wav, MP3

### b) Hashing: Convert Data into a Hash (a String)

- One-way process
- NOT reversible
- You CANNOT get the original data back!
- **Use cases:** Validate integrity of data
- **Example:** bcrypt, scrypt

Hashing is a one-way function:
```
password123  --->  hash (irreversible, unique-looking value)
```

For example (with bcrypt):
```
password123  --->  $2a$10$EixZaYVK1fsbw1ZfbX3OXePaWxn96p36Zl9kQvR6kXI6nW9jKqM4i
```

This means you never need to store the actual password. You only store its hash.

**How Authentication Works with Hashing:**
- User signs up ‚Üí you hash their password and store the hash
  - "password123" ‚Üí bcrypt("password123") ‚Üí store hash in DB
- Next time they log in, they enter password123
- Spring Security (or your code) hashes this new input
- It then compares the new hash with the one stored in DB
- If they match ‚Üí login success
- If not ‚Üí authentication failed

### c) Encryption: Encoding Data Using a Key or Password

- You need the key or password to decrypt
- **Example:** RSA

## 12. What Does JWT Contain

### a) Header

Describes how the JWT is secured.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "typ": "JWT",             // Type of token
  "alg": "HS512"            // Algorithm used for signing
}
```

Here, HS512 = HMAC with SHA-512 (hashing algorithm).
This tells whoever is validating the token: "expect HS512 algorithm."

### b) Payload (Claims)

This contains information about the user and the token. It has two types of attributes:

**Standard Claims (registered claims defined by JWT spec)**
- `iss` ‚Üí Issuer (who created the token)
- `sub` ‚Üí Subject (who the token refers to, usually user id/username)
- `aud` ‚Üí Audience (who should use this token, e.g., your app/service)
- `exp` ‚Üí Expiration time (when token becomes invalid)
- `iat` ‚Üí Issued at (when the token was created)

**Custom Claims (you define these)**

**Example:**
```json
{
  "role": "ADMIN",
  "email": "paras@example.com",
  "youratt1": "customValue"
}
```

### c) Signature

Includes a Secret

## 13. Symmetric Key Encryption

**Definition:** Same key is used for encryption and decryption.

Think of it like a shared secret (like a locker key).

**Example:**

```
Message: "Hello Paras"
Key: 12345

Encrypt("Hello Paras", 12345) ‚Üí "a94fJk*7#..."
Decrypt("a94fJk*7#...", 12345) ‚Üí "Hello Paras"
```

**Pros:**
- Very fast
- Simple to implement

**Cons:**
- Both parties must share the same key ‚Üí key distribution problem
- If key leaks, security is broken

**Use Case:**
- Database encryption

## 14. Asymmetric Key Encryption

**Definition:** Uses a key pair:
- Public Key (shared with everyone)
- Private Key (kept secret by the owner)

Message encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the other.

**Example:**

```
Public Key: üîì
Private Key: üîê

Encrypt("Hello Paras", Public Key) ‚Üí "xf72$k2#..."
Decrypt("xf72$k2#...", Private Key) ‚Üí "Hello Paras"
```

**Pros:**
- Solves key distribution problem (you can safely share public key)
- Enables digital signatures (proves authenticity)

**Cons:**
- Slower than symmetric encryption (100‚Äì1000x)
- Computationally heavy

**Use Case:**
- SSL/TLS (HTTPS handshake)
- JWT (when using RS256/RS512) ‚Üí signed with private key, verified with public key
- SSH keys
- Digital certificates

## 15. Understanding Spring Security Authentication

When a request hits your app, it passes through the Spring Security Filter Chain. At the heart of it is the authentication process.

### AuthenticationManager

Think of it as the orchestrator. It doesn't authenticate by itself ‚Äî instead, it delegates the work to one (or more) AuthenticationProviders. It tries providers in order until one succeeds.

### AuthenticationProvider

Responsible for doing actual authentication (based on a specific mechanism).

**Examples:**
- DaoAuthenticationProvider ‚Üí username + password (via DB)
- JwtAuthenticationProvider ‚Üí JWT validation
- LdapAuthenticationProvider ‚Üí LDAP/AD integration

If authentication is successful ‚Üí returns a fully populated Authentication object.

### UserDetailsService (My Code)

A core interface to fetch user data (from DB, LDAP, etc). Commonly used by DaoAuthenticationProvider. Loads: username, password (hashed), roles/authorities.

```java
public interface UserDetailsService {
    UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String username) throws UsernameNotFoundException;
}
```

After authentication succeeds, Spring Security needs to remember who the user is for the rest of the request (and session if enabled). This is done with these objects:

### Flow of Storage

```
SecurityContextHolder
    ‚Üì
SecurityContext
    ‚Üì
Authentication
    ‚Üì
Principal (UserDetails) + GrantedAuthorities
```

- **SecurityContextHolder** ‚Üí a wrapper (ThreadLocal) that stores the current user's security info
- **SecurityContext** ‚Üí contains the Authentication object
- **Authentication** ‚Üí holds details about the authenticated user
- **Principal** ‚Üí the actual user object (often a UserDetails implementation)
- **GrantedAuthority** ‚Üí roles/permissions the user has (ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN, SCOPE_READ)

### Example in Action

1. User logs in with username/password ‚Üí request passes through filter
2. AuthenticationManager delegates to DaoAuthenticationProvider
3. Provider calls UserDetailsService.loadUserByUsername()
4. Password is checked using PasswordEncoder (like bcrypt)
5. If valid ‚Üí builds UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken with:
   - Principal (user info)
   - GrantedAuthorities (roles)
6. Marks as authenticated
7. Stored in SecurityContextHolder

Now, anywhere in your app, you can get the authenticated user:

```java
Authentication auth = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication();
String username = auth.getName();
Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> roles = auth.getAuthorities();
```

### Summary

- **AuthenticationManager** ‚Üí coordinator
- **AuthenticationProvider** ‚Üí does actual authentication
- **UserDetailsService** ‚Üí loads user info (DB, LDAP, etc.)

**Result** ‚Üí stored in SecurityContextHolder ‚Üí SecurityContext ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí GrantedAuthorities

### Flow Diagram

```
User submits login form
       ‚Üì
UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken created
       ‚Üì
AuthenticationManager
       ‚Üì
AuthenticationProvider (DaoAuthenticationProvider)
       ‚Üì

       ‚Üì
Check password (PasswordEncoder)
       ‚Üì
If valid, create Authentication object
       ‚Üì
Store in SecurityContextHolder
```

# Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)

## 1. The Problem ‚Äì Cross-Cutting Concerns

When you build applications, you usually follow a layered architecture:
- **Web Layer** ‚Üí handles HTTP requests/responses, JSON/XML conversion
- **Business Layer** ‚Üí core business logic
- **Data Layer** ‚Üí persistence logic (DB access, repositories)

Now, suppose you want to add:
- Logging (track method execution, parameters, etc.)
- Security (check if user has permission)
- Performance Monitoring (how long a method takes)
- Transactions (begin/commit/rollback DB transactions)

These are not tied to a single layer. They apply across all layers. These are called **Cross-Cutting Concerns** because they "cut across" multiple layers.

Normally, you would add logging or security inside every method:

**Problem:**
- Code repetition (logging/security everywhere)
- Code tangling (business logic mixed with logging/security)
- Hard to maintain (change logging style ‚Üí update all methods)

AOP allows you to separate cross-cutting concerns into reusable modules called aspects. Instead of writing logging/security code inside each method, you declare it in a separate class (Aspect) and let AOP automatically apply it to the target methods.

## 2. Key Concepts in AOP

### Aspect

A module that encapsulates cross-cutting concern (e.g., LoggingAspect, SecurityAspect).

### Join Point

A specific point in the execution of the program, like:
- A method call
- An exception being thrown
- A field being accessed

### Pointcut

A predicate (expression) that matches join points. For example:

```java
execution(* com.myapp.service.*.*(..))
```

This matches execution of all methods in service package.

### Advice

The actual code you want to run at a join point. 

**Types of advice:**
- **Before** ‚Üí run before method execution
- **AfterReturning** ‚Üí run after method returns successfully
- **AfterThrowing** ‚Üí run if method throws exception
- **After (finally)** ‚Üí always run after method (success/failure)
- **Around** ‚Üí wrap around method execution (control execution, measure performance)

### Weaving

The process of applying aspects to target objects. Done by Spring AOP at runtime (using proxies).

## 3. Example of AOP

```java
@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {

    // Pointcut: all methods inside service package
    @Pointcut("execution(* com.myapp.service.*.*(..))")
    public void serviceMethods() {}

    // Advice: runs before method execution
    @Before("serviceMethods()")
    public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("Executing: " + joinPoint.getSignature());
    }

    // Advice: runs after method execution
    @AfterReturning(value = "serviceMethods()", returning = "result")
    public void logAfter(JoinPoint joinPoint, Object result) {
        System.out.println("Completed: " + joinPoint.getSignature() + " with result = " + result);
    }

    // Around Advice (performance monitoring)
    @Around("serviceMethods()")
    public Object measureTime(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable {
        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
        Object result = pjp.proceed(); // execute actual method
        long timeTaken = System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
        System.out.println("Time taken by " + pjp.getSignature() + ": " + timeTaken + "ms");
        return result;
    }
}
```

## 4. Pointcut Syntax

```java
execution(* com.myapp.service.UserService.*(..))   // all methods in UserService
execution(* com.myapp.service.*.*(..))             // all methods in service package
execution(public * *(..))                          // all public methods
execution(* *(String, ..))                         // methods with first param String
execution(* save*(..))                             // methods starting with save
execution(* com.myapp..*(..))                      // methods in package & subpackages
```
