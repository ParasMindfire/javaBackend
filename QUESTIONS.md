## 1)in 02-spring-core-demo > 01-constructor-injection how autowired worked 


### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Your `DemoController` constructor

```java
@Autowired
public DemoController(Coach theCoach) {
    this.myCoach = theCoach;
}
```

* The `@Autowired` on the constructor tells Spring:

  > ‚ÄúHey Spring, when creating `DemoController`, find a bean of type `Coach` and pass it as `theCoach`.‚Äù

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ The `CricketCoach` bean

```java
@Component
public class CricketCoach implements Coach {
    public String getDailyWorkout() {
        return "Practise fast  for 15mins";
    }
}
```

* `@Component` tells Spring:

  > ‚ÄúMake an instance of `CricketCoach` and register it in the **ApplicationContext** as a bean.‚Äù
* `CricketCoach` **implements `Coach`**, so it is a candidate whenever Spring needs a `Coach` bean.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ How Spring injects the dependency

1. Spring sees `DemoController` is a bean (because it‚Äôs annotated with `@RestController`, which is a specialization of `@Component`).
2. Spring notices the constructor has `@Autowired` and the parameter type is `Coach`.
3. Spring searches the **ApplicationContext** for a bean of type `Coach`.
4. It finds `CricketCoach` (since it‚Äôs a `@Component` implementing `Coach`).
5. Spring calls the constructor:

   ```java
   new DemoController(cricketCoachInstance);
   ```

   and assigns it to `myCoach`.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Result

Now, whenever you call:

```java
@GetMapping({"/dialyworkout"})
public String getDailyWorkout() {
    return this.myCoach.getDailyWorkout();
}
```

* Spring uses the injected `CricketCoach` instance.
* The endpoint `/dialyworkout` returns:

```
Practise fast for 15mins
```

---

üí° **Key points:**

* Spring injects **by type** (`Coach` ‚Üí `CricketCoach`).
* If multiple beans implement `Coach`, you‚Äôd need `@Qualifier` to specify which one.
* Constructor injection (like here) is **preferred** because it ensures the dependency is always provided and makes the class easier to test.

---




## 2) what does lazy do in 02-spring-core-demo > 06-lazy-initialisation

Ah! Now we are in **Spring Lazy Initialization** territory. Let‚Äôs break it down clearly using your code.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What `@Lazy` does

```java
@Component
@Lazy
public class BaseballCoach implements Coach { ... }
```

* Normally, Spring creates **all singleton beans at startup** when the application context is initialized.

  * That means, constructors of all `@Component` beans are called immediately.
  * You would see `System.out.println` for all beans when the app starts.

* **`@Lazy` changes this behavior**:

  * The bean **will not be created at startup**.
  * Spring will create it **only when it is first requested** (i.e., injected somewhere or explicitly retrieved from the context).

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How it works in your example

You have multiple beans implementing `Coach`:

| Bean            | Annotation            | Output at startup                     |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `CricketCoach`  | `@Component`          | Prints: `Constructor of CricketCoach` |
| `TennisCoach`   | `@Component @Primary` | Prints: `Constructor of TennisCoach`  |
| `TrackCoach`    | `@Component`          | Prints: `Constructor of track coach`  |
| `BaseballCoach` | `@Component @Lazy`    | **Does not print yet**                |

* **At startup**, Spring will **skip creating `BaseballCoach`**.
* When you inject it somewhere, like:

```java
@Autowired
private BaseballCoach baseballCoach;
```

* Only then will Spring call its constructor and you will see:

```
Constructor of baseballCOach
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Key points about `@Lazy`

1. Works **only for singleton beans** (by default).
2. Can be used at:

   * Class level (`@Component @Lazy`) ‚Üí delays bean creation
   * Injection point (`@Lazy @Autowired`) ‚Üí delays dependency injection
3. Useful when:

   * Bean initialization is expensive (heavy computation, external API calls).
   * You don‚Äôt always need the bean in your app.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Real-world analogy

Think of it like **lazy-loading a video**:

* Normally, Spring **loads all videos at once** at startup.
* `@Lazy` says:

  > ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt load this video until the user actually clicks play.‚Äù

---

So in your code, **`BaseballCoach` will only be created when someone actually asks for it**, while all other coaches are created at startup.

---


## 3)what is bean scoping and what does @Scope("prototype") do in 02-spring-core-demo > 07-bean-scoping

Ah! This is a classic **Spring bean scope and dependency injection example**. Let me explain everything clearly.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What your code is doing

#### a) `DemoController`

```java
@Autowired
public void setCoach(@Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach theCoach, 
                     @Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach theAnotherCoach) {
    System.out.println("Inside demo controller");
    this.myCoach = theCoach;
    this.anotherCoach = theAnotherCoach;
}
```

* This is **setter injection** using `@Autowired`.
* `@Qualifier("cricketCoach")` tells Spring:

  > ‚ÄúInject the bean with name `cricketCoach` here.‚Äù
* You are injecting **two beans of type `Coach`**, both pointing to `cricketCoach`.

#### b) `CricketCoach`

```java
@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class CricketCoach implements Coach { ... }
```

* `@Component` ‚Üí Spring will manage this class as a bean.
* `@Scope("prototype")` ‚Üí tells Spring **do not reuse the same instance**.

  * Every time Spring is asked for this bean, it **creates a new instance**.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between singleton and prototype

| Scope     | Behavior                                         | Your code outcome                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| singleton | Only **one instance** per Spring container.      | `myCoach` and `anotherCoach` would point to **same object** |
| prototype | **New instance every time** a bean is requested. | `myCoach` and `anotherCoach` are **different objects**      |

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What happens in your controller

1. Spring sees the setter injection with two `@Qualifier("cricketCoach")`.
2. Because `CricketCoach` is **prototype scoped**:

   * `theCoach` ‚Üí new `CricketCoach` object
   * `theAnotherCoach` ‚Üí another new `CricketCoach` object
3. When you call `/check` endpoint:

```java
boolean var10000 = this.myCoach == this.anotherCoach;
return "check if both beans are mapping to same pointer :" + var10000;
```

* It prints:

```
check if both beans are mapping to same pointer :false
```

* ‚úÖ This confirms that **prototype scope creates separate instances**.

4. When you call `/dailyworkout` endpoint:

```java
return this.myCoach.getDailyWorkout();
```

* Returns:

```
Practise cricket fast for 15mins !!!
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Prototype Scope Summary

* Annotation: `@Scope("prototype")`
* Meaning: **Spring does not cache the bean**; creates a new object **every time** it is injected or retrieved from the context.
* Contrast with **singleton** (default scope):

  * Only one instance per container.
  * Every injection points to the same object.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Visual analogy

* **Singleton** ‚Üí like a single shared TV in a house; everyone watches the same TV.
* **Prototype** ‚Üí like printing a new copy of a book every time someone requests it; each person gets their own copy.

---


## 4)Difference between @Configuration + @Bean and @Component

Perfect üëç Let‚Äôs build a **side-by-side example** so you can clearly see the difference between `@Component` and `@Bean`.

---

### ‚úÖ Using `@Component`

```java
// File: SwimCoach.java
package com.paras.springCore.common;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component("aquatic")   // Bean will be registered as "aquatic"
public class SwimCoach implements Coach {
   @Override
   public String getDailyWorkout() {
      return "Swim 1000 meters as a warm up!";
   }
}
```

* Very simple: just mark it with `@Component`.
* Spring auto-detects it via **component scanning**.
* No extra configuration required.

---

### ‚úÖ Using `@Configuration + @Bean`

```java
// File: SportConfig.java
package com.paras.springCore.config;

import com.paras.springCore.common.SwimCoach;
import com.paras.springCore.common.Coach;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class SportConfig {

   @Bean("aquatic")   // Bean will also be registered as "aquatic"
   public Coach swimCoach() {
      SwimCoach coach = new SwimCoach();
      // Custom setup logic here
      System.out.println("Customizing SwimCoach bean before returning...");
      return coach;
   }

   @Bean("fastSwimCoach")
   public Coach fastSwimCoach() {
      return new SwimCoach();   // different bean with same class
   }
}
```

* Here you **manually create** the bean with custom logic.
* You can even register **multiple beans** from the same class (`aquatic`, `fastSwimCoach`).
* Useful when you **can‚Äôt annotate the class** (third-party libraries).

---

### ‚úÖ Comparing the two

| Feature                     | `@Component`       | `@Bean`                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Auto-detection              | Yes (via scanning) | No (you define it manually) |
| Third-party classes         | ‚ùå Not possible     | ‚úÖ Possible                  |
| Custom creation logic       | ‚ùå Limited          | ‚úÖ Full control              |
| Multiple beans of same type | ‚ùå Difficult        | ‚úÖ Easy                      |
| Simplicity                  | ‚úÖ Very simple      | ‚ùå More verbose              |

---

### ‚úÖ Injection Example

```java
@RestController
public class DemoController {

   @Autowired
   @Qualifier("aquatic")
   private Coach swimCoach;   // Could come from @Component OR @Bean

   @Autowired
   @Qualifier("fastSwimCoach")
   private Coach anotherSwimCoach;  // Only possible with @Bean
}
```

---

üëâ So, **use `@Component` when it‚Äôs your own class** and no special config is needed.
üëâ Use **`@Bean` when you need custom creation logic or want to register third-party classes**.

---


## 5) Why is DAO needed ?

Great question üöÄ Let‚Äôs break down **DAO (Data Access Object)** in simple terms with reasoning on *why it is necessary*.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is DAO?

* **DAO = Data Access Object**
* It is a **design pattern** used to **separate database access logic** from the rest of the application.
* DAO provides an **abstraction layer** between the business logic and the database (JDBC, JPA, Hibernate, etc.).

üëâ In simple words:
DAO acts like a **middleman** between your application and the database.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Without DAO (Bad Design)

Suppose you have a `StudentService` that directly talks to the database:

```java
public class StudentService {

    public Student getStudent(int id) {
        Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(...);
        PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM students WHERE id=?");
        ...
        // fetch student from DB
    }
}
```

‚ùå Problems:

* Database code is **mixed with business logic**.
* Harder to **maintain** (if you change DB or queries, you must change service code).
* **Not reusable** (every service might need to duplicate DB logic).
* **Harder to test** (unit testing business logic requires a real database).

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ With DAO (Good Design)

You create a **StudentDAO** whose only responsibility is DB interaction:

```java
public interface StudentDAO {
    Student getStudent(int id);
    void saveStudent(Student student);
}
```

```java
public class StudentDAOImpl implements StudentDAO {
    @Override
    public Student getStudent(int id) {
        // all DB-related code here
        return new Student(id, "Paras");
    }

    @Override
    public void saveStudent(Student student) {
        // insert into database
    }
}
```

Now your **Service Layer** uses DAO:

```java
public class StudentService {
    private StudentDAO studentDAO;

    public StudentService(StudentDAO studentDAO) {
        this.studentDAO = studentDAO;
    }

    public Student fetchStudent(int id) {
        return studentDAO.getStudent(id); // business logic separate
    }
}
```

‚úÖ Benefits:

* **Separation of concerns** ‚Üí DB logic is isolated in DAO.
* **Reusability** ‚Üí DAO can be used by multiple services.
* **Flexibility** ‚Üí Easy to switch from MySQL ‚Üí MongoDB ‚Üí JPA ‚Üí Hibernate without changing business logic.
* **Testability** ‚Üí You can mock DAO for testing without hitting a real database.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Why is DAO necessary?

* To keep **business logic clean** and independent of database operations.
* To make code **maintainable** and **scalable**.
* To support **different databases/ORMs** easily.
* To make **unit testing** possible without requiring a real database.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Analogy

Think of DAO like a **waiter in a restaurant**:

* The waiter (DAO) takes your order (business request) and communicates with the kitchen (database).
* You (business logic) don‚Äôt directly talk to the kitchen (database).
* If the kitchen changes (MySQL ‚Üí PostgreSQL), you don‚Äôt care ‚Äî the waiter adapts.

---

üëâ **In Spring**, we often use:

* `JdbcTemplate` with DAO classes.
* Or JPA repositories (`Spring Data JPA`) which are like pre-built DAOs.

---

Got it üëç Here‚Äôs your set of questions written in a neat **README.md format**:  

---


## 6a) Database Connection & Table Creation
- How does the database get connected through `application.properties`?  
- Does that configuration allow the `EntityManager` to automatically create tables in the database with the given fields from the entity classes?

---

## 6b) Multiple Entities & Persist Behavior
- In `StudentDAOimpl` we have:
  ```java
  @Autowired 
  public StudentDAOimpl(EntityManager entityManager) {
      this.entityManager = entityManager;
  }
  ```
  What happens if there are multiple entities like `Student`, `Teacher`, etc.?  
- How does:
  ```java
  entityManager.persist(theStudent);
  ```
  know to save the data specifically in the **student** table and not in a different table?

---

## 6c) `find` vs `createQuery`
- Why in some cases do we use:
  ```java
  return entityManager.find(Student.class, id);
  ```
  while in other cases we write:
  ```java
  TypedQuery<Student> query = 
      entityManager.createQuery("FROM Student ORDER BY id DESC", Student.class);
  ```
- What is the difference between using `find` and writing custom queries with `TypedQuery`?

---

## 6d) Is the code in repo 03-springboot-hibernate-jpa-crud > StudentDAOimpl raw JPA ?


Nice set of code ‚Äî good job getting this far. I‚Äôll answer your numbered doubts one-by-one, explain the why, and give a few small suggestions / best-practices you can copy into your project.

---

### 1) Did Hibernate create the `student` table automatically?

**Yes (if `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update` is active and your app actually started and connected to the DB).**

* `@Entity` on `Student` + Spring Boot + Hibernate (the JPA provider) ‚Üí Hibernate inspects your entity and maps it to a table.
* `@Table(name="student")` tells Hibernate the DB table name explicitly. If you didn‚Äôt supply `@Table`, Hibernate would default the table name (usually the entity class name).
* `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update` tells Hibernate to update the DB schema to match your entities.

  * `create` = drop & create each start (dangerous for prod)
  * `update` = alter tables to match entities (safe-ish for development)
  * `validate` = only check, don‚Äôt change DB
  * `none` = do nothing

So when your app starts, Hibernate created/updated the `student` table according to the `Student` fields and annotations.

---

Great follow-up üëç Let‚Äôs go step by step.

---

### **2) About `@Autowired EntityManager` and multiple entities**

```java
private EntityManager entityManager;

@Autowired
public StudentDAOimpl(EntityManager entityManager) {
    this.entityManager = entityManager;
}
```

* **`EntityManager` is not per-entity**.
  It is a **general-purpose object** provided by JPA that can manage **all entities in your persistence context** (all the entities annotated with `@Entity` in your project).

* When you autowire `EntityManager`, Spring Boot creates a **single `EntityManagerFactory`** (based on your `spring.datasource.*` config).
  From this factory, it provides a single `EntityManager` bean by default (unless you configure multiple datasources).

‚úÖ So, even if you have multiple entities (`Student`, `Teacher`, `Course`, etc.), **you still get the same `EntityManager` instance**.
It doesn‚Äôt care which entity‚Äîit will handle all of them.
When you do:

```java
entityManager.persist(student);
```

JPA looks at the **runtime type of the object** (here `Student`), and because your class is annotated with `@Entity` + `@Table(name="student")`, it knows which table (`student`) to use.

üëâ In short: `EntityManager` is shared, and the mapping to the correct table is decided by the entity class annotation (`@Entity`, `@Table`), not by the `EntityManager`.

---

### **3) Default vs Custom Queries**

Yes, exactly ‚úÖ

* `EntityManager` has **basic built-in operations** for **single-entity actions**:

  * `persist(entity)` ‚Üí INSERT new record
  * `find(EntityClass.class, id)` ‚Üí SELECT by primary key
  * `merge(entity)` ‚Üí UPDATE existing record
  * `remove(entity)` ‚Üí DELETE

These are universal operations, and JPA knows how to generate SQL based on the entity metadata (`@Entity`, `@Column`, etc.).

* But when you want **custom queries** (like `findByLastName`, `findAllSorted`, `deleteAll`), you have to write **JPQL** or **native SQL**:

```java
TypedQuery<Student> query =
    entityManager.createQuery("FROM Student WHERE lastName = :lname", Student.class);
```

Because JPA can‚Äôt guess these custom requirements‚Äîit only knows about basic persistence operations.

---

‚úÖ **Answer in short:**

1. `@Autowired EntityManager` ‚Üí Always injects the one tied to your datasource (manages all entities).
2. The actual entity-to-table mapping comes from the entity class annotations (`@Entity`, `@Table`).
3. `find/persist/merge/remove` = default CRUD operations.
   For anything else (filters, ordering, joins) ‚Üí you must write JPQL.

---

Would you like me to also show you **how this changes when you have multiple datasources** (e.g., 2 different DBs, each with its own `EntityManager`)? That‚Äôs the scenario where Spring might get confused.

### 4) Is this raw JPA?

**Yes ‚Äî this is JPA (Jakarta Persistence API) code using `EntityManager`.** Hibernate is the JPA implementation under the hood (as suggested by your `spring.jpa.hibernate.*` properties).

* You are using *programmatic JPA* (EntityManager + JPQL). This is perfectly valid JPA.
* **Contrast:** Spring Data JPA (`JpaRepository`) is a higher-level abstraction that reduces boilerplate (you define interfaces and Spring provides implementations).

  * Your DAO is a classic JPA DAO implementation (not Spring Data).

---





## 6e) does studentDao get created before this and passed as an argument ?? how is this working ?

```java
@Bean public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(StudentDAO studentDAO){ 
   return _ -> { 
      createMultipleStudent(studentDAO); 
   }; 
}

```

Great question üöÄ You‚Äôre diving into one of the **core Spring Boot mechanisms**: dependency injection + bean lifecycle. Let‚Äôs break it down step by step.

---

### Code in Question

```java
@Bean
public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(StudentDAO studentDAO) {
    return _ -> {
        createMultipleStudent(studentDAO);
        // other methods...
    };
}
```

### üîπ Does `StudentDAO` get created before this?

‚úÖ Yes.
Here‚Äôs the order:

1. Spring Boot starts and scans your project for `@Component`, `@Repository`, `@Service`, and `@Bean` definitions.
2. It finds `StudentDAOimpl` (since you annotated it with `@Repository`) and creates a `StudentDAOimpl` bean.

   * This bean needs an `EntityManager`.
   * Spring Boot auto-configures an `EntityManager` based on `application.properties` (using DataSource + Hibernate).
   * The `EntityManager` is injected into `StudentDAOimpl` via constructor.
3. Now the `StudentDAO` bean is ready.
4. Spring sees your `@Bean public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner(StudentDAO studentDAO)` method.

   * Since a `StudentDAO` bean already exists, it injects that bean here.
5. After the application context is loaded, Spring executes all `CommandLineRunner` beans.

   * That‚Äôs when your code (`createMultipleStudent(studentDAO)`) actually runs.

---

### üîπ Why does this work?

Because Spring Boot‚Äôs **IoC container (ApplicationContext)** resolves dependencies **before running any `CommandLineRunner` beans**.

Think of it like this:

* First ‚Üí Spring wires up **all beans** (like `StudentDAO`, `EntityManager`, etc.)
* Then ‚Üí It passes those beans into your method arguments.
* Finally ‚Üí After context startup, the runner executes your logic.

---

‚úÖ So yes, your assumption is right:
üëâ `StudentDAO` is created **before** this method executes, and it is **passed automatically** as an argument by Spring.

---


## 7)Do i need to create custom exception everytime like in 04-springboot-rest-crud > 01-springboot-rest-crud ?

---

### üîπ Do you need separate exception classes?

üëâ **Not always.**
It depends on **how specific you want your exception handling to be**.

---

### ‚úÖ Option 1: Use a few custom exceptions (best for clarity)

For example:

* `StudentNotFoundException` ‚Üí thrown when a student with given ID doesn‚Äôt exist.
* `CourseNotFoundException` ‚Üí for missing course.
* `ValidationException` ‚Üí for invalid inputs.

This gives you **fine-grained control** in your `@ExceptionHandler`, and your error messages are clearer.

```java
@ExceptionHandler
public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleException(StudentNotFoundException exc) {
    return buildErrorResponse(exc, HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Option 2: Use one generic exception (best for simplicity)

Instead of multiple exceptions, you could create **one custom exception** like `ResourceNotFoundException` and reuse it for students, courses, etc.

```java
throw new ResourceNotFoundException("Student not found with id - " + id);
```

And handle it in one place:

```java
@ExceptionHandler
public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleException(ResourceNotFoundException exc) {
    return buildErrorResponse(exc, HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Option 3: Rely on built-in exceptions

Spring and JPA already throw exceptions like:

* `EntityNotFoundException`
* `DataIntegrityViolationException`
* `MethodArgumentNotValidException` (for validations)

You can catch these in your **global exception handler** without making custom classes at all.

---

### üîπ Best Practice in Real Projects

* Use **a few custom exceptions** where it makes sense (`NotFoundException`, `ValidationException`).
* Reuse them across multiple entities (instead of making `StudentNotFoundException`, `CourseNotFoundException`, etc., just have one `ResourceNotFoundException`).
* Create **specialized ones** only if they need different handling logic.

---

So, short answer to your question:
üëâ **No, you don‚Äôt need separate exception classes for each entity.**
You can:

* use a **generic one** (e.g., `ResourceNotFoundException`),
* or keep a few specific ones depending on your project complexity.

---



## 8) what does @ControllerAdvice do in 02-spring-global-exceptionHandler is it for writing clean codes 

---

### üîπ What is `@ControllerAdvice`?

* `@ControllerAdvice` is a **Spring annotation** used to handle exceptions **globally** across all controllers.
* Instead of writing `@ExceptionHandler` inside every controller, you write them **once** inside a `@ControllerAdvice` class.
* Think of it as a **"global error handler"** for your REST API.

---

### üîπ How does it work here?

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class StudentRestExceptionHandler {
    
    // Handles StudentNotFoundException only
    @ExceptionHandler
    public ResponseEntity<StudentErrorResponse> handleException(StudentNotFoundException exc) {
        StudentErrorResponse error = new StudentErrorResponse();
        error.setStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND.value());
        error.setMessage(exc.getMessage());
        error.setTimeStamp(System.currentTimeMillis());
        return new ResponseEntity<>(error, HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
    }

    // Handles any other Exception (generic fallback)
    @ExceptionHandler
    public ResponseEntity<StudentErrorResponse> handleException(Exception exc) {
        StudentErrorResponse error = new StudentErrorResponse();
        error.setStatus(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.value());
        error.setMessage(exc.getMessage());
        error.setTimeStamp(System.currentTimeMillis());
        return new ResponseEntity<>(error, HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
    }
}
```

* If your controller throws `StudentNotFoundException`, the **first handler** runs.
* If it throws any other unhandled exception, the **second handler** runs as a **fallback**.

---

### üîπ Why separate file (`StudentRestExceptionHandler`)?

üëâ **Clean code & separation of concerns**:

* Your controller should focus only on **business logic** (like fetching/updating students).
* Your exception handler should focus only on **error responses**.
* With `@ControllerAdvice`, you can reuse this handler for **all controllers** in your project without duplicating code.

---

### üîπ Quick Analogy

Think of `@ControllerAdvice` as a **global customer service desk** in a company:

* If a problem happens in **any department (controller)**, instead of each department handling complaints differently, everything is forwarded to the **customer service desk (ControllerAdvice)** which gives a **standardized response**.

---



## 9)Why did we add ObjectMapper in 04-springboot-rest-crud > 03-spring-boot-restCrudEmployee ??
---

### üîπ Why convert `Employee` to JSON with `ObjectMapper` in PATCH?

* **Incoming request JSON:**

```json
{
    "firstName": "John",
    "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

* Spring Boot already **deserializes this JSON** into your method parameter `Map<String,Object> patchPayload`. ‚úÖ

  * So you **do have the patch as a Java Map**.

* `tempEmployee` is the **existing Employee object** from the database.

* Now the goal of PATCH: **update only the fields present in the patch** without touching the others.

---

### üîπ Why not just update `tempEmployee` directly?

You could do it manually:

```java
if(patchPayload.containsKey("firstName")) {
    tempEmployee.setFirstName((String) patchPayload.get("firstName"));
}
if(patchPayload.containsKey("email")) {
    tempEmployee.setEmail((String) patchPayload.get("email"));
}
```

* Works, but if `Employee` has **many fields**, this becomes **boilerplate and error-prone**.

### üîπ How `ObjectMapper` helps

```java
ObjectNode employeeNode = objectMapper.convertValue(tempEmployee, ObjectNode.class);
ObjectNode patchNode = objectMapper.convertValue(patchPayload, ObjectNode.class);
employeeNode.setAll(patchNode);
return objectMapper.convertValue(employeeNode, Employee.class);
```

* Converts the existing Employee ‚Üí JSON tree (`ObjectNode`)
* Converts the patch Map ‚Üí JSON tree
* Merges them automatically (`setAll`)
* Converts back to Employee object

‚úÖ **Result:** All fields in the patch override the existing ones, and all other fields remain unchanged.

### üîπ Key point

* **Incoming request is JSON** ‚Üí Spring converts it into a **Map** (`@RequestBody Map<String,Object>`).
* **Why convert Employee to JSON?** ‚Üí To **merge the incoming patch with existing object dynamically**, without manually checking each field.

So, yes, the request is JSON, but your **existing Employee object is Java**, and you need a way to combine the two. `ObjectMapper` makes that clean.
